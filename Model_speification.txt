Model Questions:
- Fixed factors to investigate?
- Best screening design?
- Best design? (is there a specific design that would be most appropriate for our type of data?)
- Exact specification of response variables (continuous, categorical etc.)
- Specific null hypothesis or just treatment effect vs. no treatment effect (TE)
- Investigating interaction effects / higher order effects?
- Choice of predictive model (would depend on the data and hypothesis we wish to test)
- Discussion around blocking variables (variables that can lead our questions around treatment effect, e.g. should we block spend to allow comparison of treatments within spend bands - block size?)
- Are we interested in optimizing treatment factor selection? Or just ranking of treatment effectiveness within blocks?
    Particularly if the treatments are allocated based on budget and the various treatments cannot be varied in terms of their current factor levels

Design Questions:
- Can we ensure that randomization/blocking is executed properly
- Can we capture all the factors relevant to personalization engine
